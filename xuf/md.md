# Markdown
HTML, TL;DW Edition.

## Markwhere?
The [original markdown syntax 'spec'](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) was published on the blog of a cool dude named John, who also gifted the world a Perl script for converting files from this new not-quite-a-new-language language into HTML Mark*up* that we all already knew and ~~barely~~ tolerated. Most of the useful features without most of the <cruft>? "Sign me up", said almost every programmer, everywhere, ~~all at once~~ eventually.

As good as this humble syntax spec was, it suffered from the original sin of many a computational artefact before it: ambiguity. This is, of course, not John or Markdown's fault; it was pretty normal: most things in existence that have not had ambiguity scrubbed out of them by many eyes & hands through a rigorous process are going to be ambiguous, and the strain between freedom & utility eventually made this annoying to a critical mass of dedicated ~~nerds~~ users that they eventually got together for their favorite hobbies: formalization. Thus was born [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org), the one Markdown Spec to rule them all. GitHub - the platform on which many folks likely first encounter the syntax (being a fan of such standardizations) adopted/adapted CM for its own formalization of their popular [markdown 'flavor'](https://github.github.com/gfm/), and the rest is history.

These are my notes on Markdown, written in Markdown.
